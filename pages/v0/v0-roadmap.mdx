# 🚀 Prioris V0 Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the minimal working features required to build a testable prototype of Prioris, organized sequentially to reflect the logical development pipeline.

---

## 🚧 Sequential Development Pipeline for V0

### 1. 🖥️ Developer & Testing Tools

- **CLI interface**
  - Establish a basic command-line environment for rapid iteration and testing.

- **Local memory (JSON or SQLite)**
  - Set up simple persistent storage for basic data retention.

---

### 2. 🧠 Core AI Functionality

- **Static GPT-4 request**
  - Integrate basic GPT-4 API calls for initial testing and responses.

- **One-shot command execution**
  - Implement simple prompt-response interactions without memory or context.

- **Hardcoded personality prompt**
  - Define a single, consistent personality prompt for initial interactions.

---

### 3. 🗣️ Voice Interaction

- **Push-to-talk or basic wake word**
  - Enable basic interaction triggers via manual keypress or minimal wake word.

- **Basic STT (Speech-to-Text)**
  - Integrate Whisper or Deepgram for reliable speech transcription.

- **Basic TTS (Text-to-Speech)**
  - Implement Google Cloud TTS for natural-sounding responses, with plans for Coqui TTS offline fallback.

---

### 4. 📋 Basic Task Management

- **Simple list storage (local)**
  - Allow storing basic tasks or notes locally.

- **Local timer/reminder**
  - Enable basic alerts and reminders without external integrations.

---

### 5. 🌐 Basic Web Interaction

- **Web search + summary**
  - Integrate SerpAPI or similar service to fetch and summarize web content.

---

### 6. 💬 Communication Testing

- **Telegram echo bot**
  - Set up basic send/reply functionality via Telegram.

- **Fake email draft**
  - Simulate email creation without actual sending logic.

---

## ✅ V0 Goals & Outcomes

By completing these features sequentially, we'll achieve:

- A functional, testable prototype demonstrating core interaction patterns.
- Basic voice-driven interactions and responses.
- Simple task management and communication simulations.
- A solid foundation for iterative development towards V1.
