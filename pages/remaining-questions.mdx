## ‚ùì Remaining Questions / Configurable Options

### üîå Hosting & Deployment Strategy

| Question | Options | Considerations |
| -------- | ------- | -------------- |
| Should Prioris run fully self-hosted or use managed services for LLMs and APIs? | - Fully self-hosted<br/>- Hybrid (self-hosted context, managed LLMs)<br/>- Fully managed | Self-hosting gives full control and privacy. Hybrid allows faster setup. Fully managed simplifies ops but may limit customization and increase cost. |

### üß† Agent Autonomy

| Question | Options | Considerations |
| -------- | ------- | -------------- |
| Should agents (e.g. email, calendar, purchase) act autonomously or always ask before executing? | - Always ask<br/>- Ask only for sensitive actions<br/>- Fully autonomous (user-defined) | Autonomy increases fluidity but raises risk. Best approach is per-agent permissions with user toggles. |

### üõ†Ô∏è Voice Control vs. GUI Access

| Question | Options | Considerations |
| -------- | ------- | -------------- |
| Will Prioris be fully voice-controlled or also feature a GUI dashboard? | - Voice-only<br/>- Voice + Web Dashboard<br/>- Native mobile/desktop app | Web dashboard is useful for managing settings, reviewing memory, and debugging. Voice-only may suffice for minimal interfaces like wearables. |

### üì¶ Plugin & Automation System

| Question | Options | Considerations |
| -------- | ------- | -------------- |
| Should Prioris support third-party plugins or only allow curated integrations? | - Closed system (only official integrations)<br/>- Curated marketplace<br/>- Open plugin architecture | Open plugins increase extensibility and community growth, but introduce security risks. May require a review/approval mechanism. |

### üìö Memory Retention & Forgetting

| Question | Options | Considerations |
| -------- | ------- | -------------- |
| How long should Prioris remember conversations, facts, and preferences? | - Session only<br/>- Manual save to long-term memory<br/>- Auto-learn mode with manual forget | More memory = better context. But retention must be transparent, editable, and secure. User-facing memory controls are key. |

---

### üîê Privacy & Security Preferences

| Question | Options | Considerations |
| -------- | ------- | -------------- |
| What privacy guarantees does Prioris provide by default? | - Local-first data retention<br/>- Fully encrypted logs and tokens<br/>- On-device execution when possible | Transparency and privacy-preserving defaults should be a cornerstone of the assistant's trust model. Voiceprint auth and passcode fallback add layers. |

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Model Preference & Runtime Behavior

| Question | Options | Considerations |
| -------- | ------- | -------------- |
| Should the user be able to choose which model handles a request? | - Smart auto-routing only<br/>- Manual override per task<br/>- Persistent model preferences | Auto-routing is fast, but some users may want explicit control (e.g., "use Claude for code tasks, GPT-4 for creative writing"). This can also help with cost optimization. |
