# Basic Cursor Rules

This section contains fundamental Cursor Rules that can be applied to a wide variety of projects, regardless of the specific technologies or frameworks used.

These basic rules provide templates and examples for common coding patterns, language-specific conventions, and workflow optimization. They serve as building blocks that can be customized for your specific project needs.

## Included Rules

1. **[React Best Practices](/cursor-rules/basic-rules/react-best-practices)**: Guidelines for writing clean, maintainable React code.

2. **[Python Conventions](/cursor-rules/basic-rules/python-conventions)**: Standards for Python code following PEP 8 and common best practices.

3. **[Chaining Rules](/cursor-rules/basic-rules/chaining-rules)**: How to combine multiple rules using the `@file` reference system.

4. **[Project-Specific Rules](/cursor-rules/basic-rules/project-specific)**: Examples of how to create rules tailored to specific project requirements.

5. **[Global Rules Setup](/cursor-rules/basic-rules/global-rules-setup)**: How to configure global rules that apply across all projects.

6. **[Workflow-Specific Rules](/cursor-rules/basic-rules/workflow-specific-rules)**: Rules dedicated to specific development workflows like code reviews, documentation, and debugging.

## Getting Started

To use these rules, copy the rule content from the specific rule page and create files in your project's `.cursor/rules` directory with the `.cursorignore` extension.

You can customize these rules to match your specific project needs by adding, removing, or modifying sections as needed.

Remember that these basic rules are meant to be foundation templates that can be adapted to suit your workflow and coding standards.
