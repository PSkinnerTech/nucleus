# Workflow-Specific Cursor Rules

This guide demonstrates how to create Cursor rules tailored to specific development workflows such as code reviews, documentation, and debugging.

## Why Create Workflow-Specific Rules?

Different development activities often require different AI guidance. By creating rules for specific workflows, you can:

- Get more specialized assistance for particular tasks
- Reduce the need to repeatedly provide the same instructions
- Establish consistent approaches to common development activities

## Code Review Rules

Create a file at `.cursor/rules/code-review.cursorignore`:

```
# Code Review Rules
# Used when reviewing code and providing feedback

# Define which files this rule applies to
*.*

# Rule content below
When helping with code reviews, follow these guidelines:

1. Analysis approach:
   - First scan for security issues and vulnerabilities
   - Look for performance bottlenecks
   - Check error handling and edge cases
   - Examine code clarity and maintainability
   - Consider test coverage

2. Security checks:
   - Identify input validation issues
   - Flag potential injection vulnerabilities
   - Check for proper authentication/authorization
   - Look for sensitive data exposure
   - Identify insecure cryptographic implementations

3. Performance checks:
   - Identify inefficient algorithms (O(nÂ²) when O(n) is possible, etc.)
   - Check for unnecessary database queries or API calls
   - Look for memory leaks or excessive resource usage
   - Identify potential concurrency issues
   - Flag redundant computations

4. Code quality checks:
   - Identify duplicated code
   - Flag overly complex methods (high cyclomatic complexity)
   - Check for SOLID principles violations
   - Look for proper error handling
   - Evaluate naming clarity

5. Feedback style:
   - Be specific and actionable
   - Explain the "why" behind suggestions
   - Prioritize issues (critical, major, minor)
   - Include code examples for suggested improvements
   - Acknowledge positive aspects of the code

6. Documentation check:
   - Verify that public APIs are documented
   - Check that complex logic has explanatory comments
   - Ensure code changes align with project documentation
   - Verify that any new features are documented
```

## Debugging Assistance Rules

Create a file at `.cursor/rules/debugging.cursorignore`:

```
# Debugging Assistance Rules
# Used when debugging issues or troubleshooting

# Define which files this rule applies to
*.*

# Rule content below
When helping with debugging, follow these guidelines:

1. Problem analysis approach:
   - Start by understanding the expected vs. actual behavior
   - Identify potential failure points systematically
   - Consider environment, configuration, and data factors
   - Look for common error patterns first
   - Use process of elimination for complex issues

2. Common checks to suggest:
   - Verify input validation
   - Check null/undefined handling
   - Look for off-by-one errors
   - Examine asynchronous code for race conditions
   - Verify error handling

3. Language-specific patterns:
   - For JavaScript/TypeScript:
     - Check Promise handling and async/await usage
     - Look for closure-related issues
     - Verify proper event handling
   - For Python:
     - Check for indentation issues
     - Verify exception handling
     - Look for common import issues
   - For Java/C#:
     - Check for thread safety
     - Verify resource cleanup
     - Look for equals/hashCode implementation issues

4. Debugging strategies to suggest:
   - Binary search through the code (comment out sections)
   - Add logging at key points
   - Use debugger breakpoints effectively
   - Isolate the issue with minimal reproduction
   - Test in isolation vs. integration

5. Response format:
   - First suggest the most likely causes
   - Provide specific debugging steps to verify each hypothesis
   - Include examples of debugging code to add
   - Suggest tools or commands that might help
   - Outline a systematic troubleshooting approach
```

## Documentation Rules

Create a file at `.cursor/rules/documentation.cursorignore`:

```
# Documentation Rules
# Used when writing or improving documentation

# Define which files this rule applies to
*.md
*.mdx
*.txt
*/docs/**/*
*/README*

# Rule content below
When helping with documentation, follow these guidelines:

1. Documentation structure:
   - Start with a clear purpose statement
   - Include a brief overview
   - Organize content from general to specific
   - Use consistent headings and subheadings
   - Include a table of contents for longer documents

2. Code examples:
   - Keep examples concise and focused
   - Include complete, runnable examples
   - Comment key parts of the code
   - Show both basic and advanced usage
   - Include expected output or results

3. API documentation:
   - Document all parameters with types and descriptions
   - Specify return values and types
   - List exceptions or errors that may be thrown
   - Include usage examples
   - Document any side effects

4. User guides:
   - Focus on user goals, not implementation details
   - Use step-by-step instructions
   - Include screenshots where helpful
   - Anticipate common questions
   - Provide troubleshooting information

5. Writing style:
   - Use active voice
   - Keep sentences and paragraphs short
   - Define technical terms on first use
   - Be consistent with terminology
   - Use numbered steps for procedures

6. Formatting:
   - Use markdown features effectively
   - Create tables for structured information
   - Use code blocks with syntax highlighting
   - Implement proper link references
   - Use emphasis sparingly for important points
```

## Architecture Decision Rules

Create a file at `.cursor/rules/architecture-decisions.cursorignore`:

```
# Architecture Decision Rules
# Used when making architectural decisions or writing ADRs

# Define which files this rule applies to
*/architecture/**/*
*/docs/adr/**/*
*.adr.md

# Rule content below
When helping with architecture decisions, follow these guidelines:

1. Decision structure:
   - State the problem clearly
   - List constraints and requirements
   - Present multiple options
   - Evaluate each option objectively
   - Make a clear recommendation with rationale

2. Evaluation criteria:
   - Performance implications
   - Scalability considerations
   - Maintenance and operational overhead
   - Security implications
   - Cost factors
   - Team familiarity and learning curve
   - Vendor or technology lock-in concerns
   - Integration complexity
   - Testing strategy

3. ADR (Architecture Decision Record) format:
   - Title: Short description of the decision
   - Status: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
   - Context: Background and the forces at play
   - Decision: The response to these forces
   - Consequences: The resulting context after applying the decision
   - References: Additional resources or related decisions

4. Technology selection approach:
   - Clearly define requirements and constraints
   - Evaluate at least 3 alternatives
   - Consider build vs. buy tradeoffs
   - Assess community support and activity
   - Review licensing implications
   - Consider future migration paths
   - Evaluate learning curve and team expertise

5. Diagrams to include:
   - Component diagrams
   - Sequence diagrams for key flows
   - Data flow diagrams
   - Deployment architecture
   - Technology stack diagram
```

## Using Workflow Rules

To effectively use workflow-specific rules:

### Method 1: Create symbolic links for current work

When switching to a specific workflow, create a symbolic link to make the appropriate rule active:

```bash
# When starting code review
ln -sf .cursor/rules/code-review.cursorignore .cursor/rules/active.cursorignore

# When switching to debugging
ln -sf .cursor/rules/debugging.cursorignore .cursor/rules/active.cursorignore
```

### Method 2: Mention the workflow in your queries

Explicitly mention the workflow in your queries to Cursor:

- "Help me review this code for security issues"
- "I'm debugging this function, what could be causing the error?"
- "Help me document this API endpoint"

### Method 3: Chain with other rules

Include workflow rules alongside your project's technical rules:

```
# In your react-component.cursorignore
@file:.cursor/rules/documentation.cursorignore

# Additional React-specific rules
```

## Benefits of Workflow-Specific Rules

1. **Consistent Approach**: Establish standard practices for common workflows
2. **Time Saving**: Avoid retyping the same instructions repeatedly
3. **Quality Improvement**: Ensure thorough handling of each workflow
4. **Knowledge Sharing**: Encode best practices for the team
5. **Focused Assistance**: Get more relevant help for your current task

By creating specialized rules for different development workflows, you can significantly enhance your productivity and ensure consistent quality across your development activities.
