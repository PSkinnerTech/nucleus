# Chaining Cursor Rules

This example shows how to chain multiple Cursor rules together using the `@file` reference system, allowing you to create modular and reusable rule sets.

## Basic Concept

When you include `@file` references in your rules, Cursor will include the content of those referenced files as context when the rule is applied. This allows you to:

1. Create modular rule components
2. Reuse common rules across multiple projects
3. Build specialized rule sets for different parts of your codebase

## Rule Structure Example

Here's an example project structure with chained rules:

```
.cursor/
  rules/
    base-conventions.cursorignore       # Base coding standards
    typescript-conventions.cursorignore # TypeScript-specific rules (references base)
    react-conventions.cursorignore      # React-specific rules (references TypeScript)
    next-conventions.cursorignore       # Next.js-specific rules (references React)
```

## Example Implementation

### 1. Base Conventions Rule

Create a file at `.cursor/rules/base-conventions.cursorignore`:

```
# Base Coding Conventions
# Contains common conventions for all code

# Define which files this rule applies to
*.*

# Rule content below
When helping with code, follow these base conventions:

1. Maintain consistent indentation and formatting
2. Add descriptive comments for complex logic
3. Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
4. Use meaningful variable and function names
5. Limit function/method length to maintain readability
6. Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
7. Properly handle errors and edge cases
8. Write code that is easy to test
9. Follow project-specific naming conventions
10. Ensure code is secure by default
```

### 2. TypeScript Conventions Rule (Builds on Base)

Create a file at `.cursor/rules/typescript-conventions.cursorignore`:

```
# TypeScript Coding Conventions
# Contains TypeScript-specific coding standards

# Define which files this rule applies to
*.ts
*.tsx

# Include base conventions
@file:.cursor/rules/base-conventions.cursorignore

# Rule content below
When helping with TypeScript code, follow these additional conventions:

1. Use explicit typing and avoid 'any' type when possible
2. Prefer interfaces for object shapes that will be used across the codebase
3. Use type aliases for complex types or unions that are reused
4. Make use of TypeScript's utility types where appropriate
5. Embrace discriminated unions for type-safe state management
6. Use readonly modifiers for immutable properties
7. Leverage const assertions for literal types
8. Follow consistent import ordering:
   - External libraries first
   - Absolute imports next
   - Relative imports last
9. Use enums for related constants
10. Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json
```

### 3. React Conventions Rule (Builds on TypeScript)

Create a file at `.cursor/rules/react-conventions.cursorignore`:

```
# React Coding Conventions
# Contains React-specific coding standards

# Define which files this rule applies to
*.jsx
*.tsx
src/components/**/*

# Include TypeScript conventions (which includes base)
@file:.cursor/rules/typescript-conventions.cursorignore

# Rule content below
When helping with React code, follow these additional conventions:

1. Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
2. Prefer named exports for components
3. Keep components focused on UI rendering, extract complex logic to hooks
4. Follow consistent prop naming:
   - Use 'on' prefix for event handlers (onClick, onSubmit)
   - Use 'handle' prefix for handler functions (handleClick, handleSubmit)
5. Use React.memo for expensive components
6. Implement proper prop validation
7. Use React Fragment instead of unnecessary div containers
8. Keep consistent file structure:
   - Components/
     - ComponentName/
       - index.tsx
       - ComponentName.module.css
       - ComponentName.test.tsx
9. Follow React rendering best practices
```

### 4. Next.js Conventions Rule (Builds on React)

Create a file at `.cursor/rules/next-conventions.cursorignore`:

```
# Next.js Coding Conventions
# Contains Next.js-specific coding standards

# Define which files this rule applies to
*.jsx
*.tsx
pages/**/*
app/**/*
components/**/*

# Include React conventions (which includes TypeScript and base)
@file:.cursor/rules/react-conventions.cursorignore

# Rule content below
When helping with Next.js code, follow these additional conventions:

1. Use the App Router patterns where possible
2. Prefer server components for non-interactive UI
3. Follow Next.js file naming conventions:
   - page.tsx for route pages
   - layout.tsx for layouts
   - loading.tsx for loading states
   - error.tsx for error handling
4. Use next/image for optimized images
5. Implement proper metadata in layouts
6. Use server actions for form submissions
7. Leverage Next.js data fetching patterns (SSR, ISR, etc.)
8. Follow the folder structure:
   - app/
     - (routes)/
       - page.tsx
       - layout.tsx
   - components/
   - lib/
   - public/
9. Use route groups for organizational purposes
10. Follow Next.js performance best practices
```

## Benefits of Chaining Rules

1. **Modularity**: Break down rules into logical, reusable components
2. **Consistency**: Share common rules across projects
3. **Organization**: Structure rules according to technology layers
4. **Maintenance**: Update shared rules in one place
5. **Flexibility**: Apply different rule combinations to different file types

By using this approach, you can create a comprehensive yet manageable set of rules that evolve with your project.
