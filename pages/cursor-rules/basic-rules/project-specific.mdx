# Project-Specific Rules

This example demonstrates how to create Cursor rules that enforce team-specific conventions and architectural patterns for a project.

## Use Case

Project-specific rules are valuable for:

- Onboarding new team members
- Ensuring consistent implementation of architectural patterns
- Enforcing business logic patterns and naming
- Maintaining code quality across the team

## Example: E-Commerce Platform Rule

This example shows a rule for a fictional e-commerce platform with specific architectural patterns and business domain language requirements.

Create a file at `.cursor/rules/ecommerce-project.cursorignore`:

```
# E-Commerce Platform Project Rules
# Enforces project-specific patterns and domain language

# Define which files this rule applies to
src/**/*
app/**/*
lib/**/*
services/**/*
models/**/*

# Rule content below
When helping with code for our e-commerce platform, follow these project-specific conventions:

### Architecture
1. Follow our layered architecture:
   - Presentation Layer (React components, pages)
   - Domain Layer (business logic, services)
   - Data Access Layer (repositories, API clients)
   - Infrastructure Layer (utilities, configuration)

2. Service pattern:
   - Services should be in the `services/` directory
   - Each service should handle a specific domain concept (e.g., CartService, ProductService)
   - Services should not import from the presentation layer
   - Services should not directly interface with external APIs - use repositories

3. Repository pattern:
   - Repositories should be in the `repositories/` directory
   - Each repository handles data access for a specific domain model
   - Repositories encapsulate all data sources (API, localStorage, etc.)
   - All external data access should go through repositories

### Domain Language
Use consistent terminology for our domain concepts:

1. Products:
   - "Product" - An item for sale 
   - "SKU" - Stock keeping unit
   - "Variant" - Specific version of a product (e.g., color, size)
   - "Category" - Product classification
   - "Collection" - Curated group of products

2. Shopping:
   - "Cart" - Current shopping session
   - "Order" - Confirmed purchase
   - "Checkout" - Process of completing an order
   - "LineItem" - Individual product in cart/order
   - "Fulfillment" - Delivery or pickup process

3. Users:
   - "Customer" - Person shopping
   - "Account" - Customer's profile
   - "Guest" - Unauthenticated customer
   - "Wishlist" - Saved products for future purchase

### Naming Conventions
1. React components:
   - PascalCase for component names
   - Prefix page components with "Page" (e.g., ProductDetailPage)
   - UI components should be generic (e.g., Button, Card)
   - Domain components should be specific (e.g., ProductCard, CartSummary)

2. Services and repositories:
   - PascalCase + "Service" or "Repository" suffix
   - e.g., ProductService, OrderRepository

3. Functions:
   - Prefix getters with "get" (e.g., getProductById)
   - Prefix operations with verbs (e.g., updateCart, placeOrder)
   - Prefix state changes with their effect (e.g., addToCart, removeFromWishlist)

### Data Handling
1. API data:
   - Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) in the repository layer
   - Transform DTOs to domain models before passing to services
   - Use Zod for schema validation

2. State management:
   - Use React Context for global state
   - Follow context naming pattern: <Domain>Context, <Domain>Provider, use<Domain>
   - Use local state for UI-specific state
   - Derive computed properties rather than storing them

### Error Handling
1. Use custom error classes for domain-specific errors
2. Handle expected exceptions in services
3. Log unexpected errors with error tracking service
4. Provide user-friendly error messages for expected errors

### Testing
1. Unit test all business logic in services
2. Use integration tests for repositories
3. Use component tests for UI components
4. Name tests descriptively with pattern: "should <expected behavior> when <condition>"
```

## Another Example: Analytics Service Rules

This demonstrates a rule for a fictional analytics service with specific requirements for tracking and reporting:

Create a file at `.cursor/rules/analytics-project.cursorignore`:

```
# Analytics Service Project Rules
# Enforces conventions for our analytics platform

# Define which files this rule applies to
src/**/*
lib/**/*
utils/analytics/**/*
components/tracking/**/*

# Rule content below
When helping with code for our analytics platform, follow these project-specific conventions:

### Event Tracking
1. Use our standardized event tracking API:
   - `trackEvent(category, action, label, value)`
   - `trackPageView(pageUrl, pageTitle)`
   - `trackConversion(goalId, value)`

2. Event naming conventions:
   - Categories: PascalCase (e.g., "UserAccount", "Purchase", "ContentInteraction")
   - Actions: lowercase with hyphens (e.g., "button-click", "form-submit", "page-scroll")
   - Labels: contextual information in lowercase (e.g., "homepage-hero", "pricing-tier-pro")

3. Custom dimensions:
   - Reference by name, not index (e.g., `setDimension('userType', 'premium')`)
   - Follow our data dictionary for dimension names

### Data Processing
1. Data transformation:
   - Use stream processing for real-time data
   - Use batch processing for historical data
   - All transformations should be pure functions

2. Aggregations:
   - Use standard aggregation functions from our utils library
   - Document time windows for all aggregations
   - Include margin of error for sampled data

### Visualization
1. Chart components:
   - All charts should use our ChartWrapper component
   - Include accessibility descriptions for all visualizations
   - Support dark/light mode

2. Dashboard layout:
   - Use grid system for layout
   - Support responsive design for all screen sizes
   - Follow progressive disclosure pattern for complex data

### Privacy Compliance
1. PII handling:
   - Never log personally identifiable information
   - Use anonymized IDs for user tracking
   - Apply data masking for sensitive fields
   - Support data deletion requests

2. Consent management:
   - Check user consent before tracking
   - Respect Do Not Track settings
   - Provide opt-out mechanism

### Performance
1. Data loading:
   - Use pagination for large datasets
   - Implement virtual scrolling for long lists
   - Show loading indicators for async operations
   - Cache repeated queries

2. Processing:
   - Use web workers for heavy calculations
   - Implement request batching where appropriate
   - Use incremental processing for large datasets

### Documentation
1. Code comments:
   - Document the "why" not just the "what"
   - Explain business logic rationale
   - Document performance considerations

2. Metrics documentation:
   - Define how each metric is calculated
   - Document data sources
   - Note limitations and caveats
```

## Creating Your Project Rules

When creating your own project rules:

1. **Analyze existing code**: Identify patterns in your current codebase
2. **Consult the team**: Get input from team members on conventions
3. **Document domain language**: Ensure consistent terminology
4. **Define architecture**: Clarify high-level architectural patterns
5. **Start small**: Begin with critical patterns and evolve over time
6. **Update regularly**: Revisit rules as the project evolves

Project-specific rules can dramatically improve consistency and help maintain quality as the team and codebase grow.
