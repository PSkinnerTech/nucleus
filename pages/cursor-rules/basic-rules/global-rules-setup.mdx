# Setting Up Global Cursor Rules

Global rules apply to all your projects and can be configured in the Cursor settings. This guide explains how to set up and use global rules effectively.

## Accessing Global Rules Settings

1. Open Cursor Settings by:
   - Using keyboard shortcut: `Cmd + ,` (Mac) or `Ctrl + ,` (Windows/Linux)
   - Or clicking on `Settings` in the menu

2. Navigate to `General` > `Rules for AI` section

## Example Global Rules

Here are some examples of effective global rules you might consider:

### 1. Response Format Preferences

```
When answering questions:
1. Be concise and direct
2. List steps numerically when providing instructions
3. Include code examples when relevant
4. Bold important terms or concepts using markdown
5. Provide small, manageable chunks of information instead of long explanations
```

### 2. Code Style Preferences

```
When writing or modifying code:
1. Use spaces for indentation, not tabs
2. Maximum line length should be 80 characters
3. Prefer meaningful variable names over abbreviations
4. Add descriptive comments for complex logic
5. Avoid excessive nesting of control structures
6. Write unit tests for any significant functionality
```

### 3. Documentation Preferences

```
When documenting code:
1. Focus on explaining "why" rather than "what"
2. Document function parameters with clear descriptions
3. Include examples for complex functions
4. Describe error cases and how they are handled
5. Note any performance implications or optimizations
```

### 4. Language Output Preferences

```
When responding:
1. Use American English spelling conventions
2. Avoid jargon unless it's industry-standard terminology
3. Keep explanations at an intermediate level, not beginner or advanced
4. Use clear, direct phrasing rather than overly formal language
```

## Benefits of Global Rules

- **Consistency**: Get consistent AI assistance across all your projects
- **Personalization**: Tailor responses to your preferences
- **Efficiency**: Save time by not repeating instructions
- **Focus**: Get responses that match your work style

## Best Practices for Global Rules

### What to Include in Global Rules

Global rules are ideal for:

1. **Personal preferences** that apply to all your work
2. **Output formatting** requirements
3. **Communication style** preferences
4. **General code conventions** you follow across projects

### What to Avoid in Global Rules

Global rules are not ideal for:

1. **Project-specific conventions** (use project rules instead)
2. **Technology-specific patterns** (use project rules targeting specific file types)
3. **Temporary requirements** that may change frequently
4. **Very lengthy or complex rules** (these are better broken into project rules)

### Finding the Right Balance

- Start with a minimal set of global rules
- Add to them gradually as you identify consistent preferences
- Periodically review and refine them
- When a rule becomes too specific, move it to project rules

## Combining Global and Project Rules

When both global and project rules apply, project rules take precedence in case of conflicts. However, both sets of rules will be considered.

Some effective combinations:

1. **Global**: General code style preferences
   **Project**: Framework-specific patterns

2. **Global**: Documentation format preferences
   **Project**: Domain-specific terminology

3. **Global**: Communication style preferences
   **Project**: Technical architecture guidelines

By thoughtfully configuring global rules, you can create a more personalized and efficient experience when working with AI in Cursor across all your projects.
