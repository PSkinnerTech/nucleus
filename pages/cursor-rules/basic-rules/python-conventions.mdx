# Python Conventions Rule

This example demonstrates how to create a Cursor rule that enforces Python coding conventions and PEP 8 standards.

## Rule Configuration

Create a file at `.cursor/rules/python-conventions.cursorignore` with the following content:

```
# Python Coding Conventions Rule
# This rule applies to Python files and enforces PEP 8 standards

# Define which files this rule applies to
*.py
src/**/*.py
tests/**/*.py

# Rule content below
When helping with Python code, enforce these coding conventions:

1. Follow PEP 8 style guide:
   - Use 4 spaces per indentation level, not tabs
   - Maximum line length of 79 characters for code and 72 for docstrings/comments
   - Use snake_case for variables, functions, and methods
   - Use PascalCase for class names
   - Use UPPER_CASE for constants
   - Use trailing commas in multi-line data structures
   - Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines

2. Documentation:
   - Use docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods
   - Use Google-style docstrings with type annotations
   - Include examples in docstrings where helpful

3. Imports:
   - Group imports in the following order with a blank line between groups:
     1. Standard library imports
     2. Related third-party imports
     3. Local application/library specific imports
   - Prefer absolute imports over relative imports
   - Avoid using wildcard imports (from module import *)

4. Error handling:
   - Use specific exception types rather than bare except clauses
   - Handle exceptions where they make sense, not blanket try/except blocks
   - Use context managers (with statements) for resource management

5. Testing:
   - Write tests for all new functionality
   - Follow a test naming convention like test_<function_name>_<scenario>
```

## Using the Rule

When this rule is added to your project:

1. Cursor will automatically apply these guidelines when you are working with Python files
2. The rule will only affect files matching the patterns (*.py and files in src/ and tests/ directories)
3. The AI assistant will follow PEP 8 standards when generating or modifying Python code

## Sample Python Module Following This Rule
