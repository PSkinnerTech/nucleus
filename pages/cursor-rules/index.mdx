# Understanding Cursor Rules

Cursor Rules are a powerful way to customize AI behavior in Cursor. They act as instructions or system prompts for the underlying LLM, helping you get more consistent and specialized assistance.

## Types of Cursor Rules

### 1. Project Rules (Recommended)

Project rules are specific to a project and stored in the `.cursor/rules` directory. These rules offer:

- **Semantic Descriptions**: Each rule includes instructions on when it should be applied
- **File Pattern Matching**: Uses gitignore-style patterns to specify which files/folders the rule applies to
- **Automatic Attachment**: Rules are automatically included when matching files are referenced
- **Reference files**: Use `@file` in your rules to include other files as context

### 2. Global Rules

Global rules apply to all projects and are configured in `Cursor Settings` > `General` > `Rules for AI`. These are useful for consistent preferences across all projects.

### 3. Legacy .cursorrules (Deprecated)

While still supported for backward compatibility, the `.cursorrules` file in the project root is being phased out in favor of the more flexible Project Rules system.

## Rule Categories in This Guide

This guide is organized into two main categories:

### [Basic Rules](/cursor-rules/basic-rules)

General-purpose rules that can be applied to most projects:
- Language-specific conventions (React, Python, etc.)
- Workflow optimizations (code reviews, documentation, etc.)
- General best practices and patterns

### [Project-Specific Rules](/cursor-rules/v0)

Rules tailored for specific projects, including:
- Rules for the Rin V0 developer and testing guide
- Step-by-step implementation rules for specific features

## Creating a New Rule

To create a new rule:
1. Use the command palette: `Cmd + Shift + P` > `New Cursor Rule`
2. Or manually create a file in the `.cursor/rules` directory with the `.cursorignore` extension

Browse through the sections to find rules that fit your needs, or use them as starting points to create your own customized rules.
